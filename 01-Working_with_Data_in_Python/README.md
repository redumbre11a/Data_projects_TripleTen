# TripleTen Sprint 1 Project - Working with Data in Python

## Description
You work as an analyst for Yandex Music Company. In this project, you'll compare the music preferences of the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. You'll study real Yandex.Music data to test three hypotheses and compare user behavior for these two cities.

Your project will consist of three stages:

Data overview
Data preprocessing
Testing the hypotheses

Using your new knowledge of working with data in Python, you will evaluate the quality of the data and determine if there are significant issues before using the data for analysis and testing the hypotheses.
